        ## Usage:
        
        
        ### Template tags:
        
        * Get the favorited objects for a given user:
        
        ```python
        {% with user_favorites <user> "app_label.model" as favorite_list %}
            {% for fav_obj in favorite_list %}
                {# do something with fav_obj #}
            {% endfor %}
        {% endwith %}
        ```
        
        
        * Given an object `obj` you may show it fav count like this:
        
        ```python
        <p>Favorite Count {{ obj|favorites_count }}</p>
        ```
        
        
        * Get Favorite instance for an object (obj) and a user (user)
        
        ```python
        {% with obj|get_favorite_for:user as fav_object %}
            ...
        {% endwith %}
        ```
        
        * Favorite Button for an object `my_obj`:
        
        ```python
        {% favorite_button my_obj %}
        ```
        
        
        ### Favorites Manager
        
        * Create a Favorite instance for a user and object:
        
        ```python
        >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        >>> from music.models import Song
        >>> user = User.objects.get(username='jdoe')
        >>> song = Song.objects.get(pk=1)
        >>> fav = Favorite.objects.create(user, song)
        ```
        
            or:
        
        ```python
        >>> fav = Favorite.objects.create(user, 1, Song)
        ```
        
            or:
        
        ```python
        >>> fav = Favorite.objects.create(user, 1, "music.Song")
        ```
        
         * Get the objects favorited by a given user:
        
        ```python
        >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        >>> user = User.objects.get(username='jdoe')
        >>> Favorite.objects.for_user(user)
        >>> [<Favorite: Favorite object 1>, <Favorite: Favorite object 2>, <Favorite: Favorite object 3>]
        ```
        
        * Now, get user favorited objects belonging to a given model:
        
        ```python
        >>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        >>> from music.models import Song
        >>> user = User.objects.get(username='jdoe')
        >>> Favorite.objects.for_user(user, model=Song)
        >>> [<Favorite: Favorite object 1>, <Favorite: Favorite object 2>, <Favorite: Favorite object 3>]
        ```
        
        * Get the favorited object instances of a given model favorited by any user:
        
        ```python
        >>> from music.models import Song
        >>> Favorite.objects.for_model(Song)
        >>> [<Favorite: Favorite object 1>, <Favorite: Favorite object 2>, <Favorite: Favorite object 3>]
        ```

        >>> user = User.objects.get(username='jdoe')
        >>> song = Song.objects.get(pk=1)
        >>> fav = Favorite.objects.get_favorite(user, song)
        ```
        
        * Get all Favorite instances for a given object
        
        ```python
